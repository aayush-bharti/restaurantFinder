# Restaurant Finder
This project utilizes Swift UI and the Google Places API to allow users to browse the map for restaurants nearby them. For each restaurant on the map, the user is able to click on the restaurant which will open a sheet with more information about the restaurant such as Rating, Hours of Operation, and Address. Users are able to add the restaurants to their favorites as well which is shown on the application and saved under their username. 
In the favorited restaurants, users can find restaurants they have favorited and can add restaurants to the list as well. For each restaurant, they can click on it and see the information about the restaurant that were shown on the map. Additionally, they can add their favorite food items at the restaurant which will be saved under the specific restaurant.
